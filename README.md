# webshell
Web interface to server command line using Java Runtime.
Some commands are custom implemented due to Runtime limitations.
Commands that requires server tty (i.e. vim) won't work.

Custom commands:
- wsget - Download a file from the server.
- wsedit - Edit a file on the server.
- Upload area - Drag a file in this area to upload a file.
- Output appenders (>, >>, 2>, 2>>) - append command output to destination. i.e. ls > listFiles



Use this tool on your own risk.
